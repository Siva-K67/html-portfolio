 <h1>Best Movies For Me</h1>
 <h2>Movies which I liked a lot</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>Interstellar</h3>
 <p>Christopher Nolan simply blew away my mind. I wish I really were an astronaut. I wouldn't mind dying in space.</p>
 <h3>Spider Man (Into and Accross the Spiderverse) </h3>
 <p>I loved these both animated parts ! Miles Morales is simply awesome! So much Love was poured into making these movies!</p>
 <h3>The Batman Triology</h3>
 <p>Again a masterpeice by Nolan. I always used to think Batman is so useless with literally no super powers. Now now I realise that what an awesome comic character he can be!</p>
